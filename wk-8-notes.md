Errors I've encountered:

1. Week 5: simple statistics in R for archaeologists

The first block of code I run, it gives me an error saying "'lib' is unspecified"
and "package 'binary' is not available for this version of R

2. Week 6: Roman network analysis

second block of code: importerror: unable to import required dependencies
