I started this week off by going back to week 5 and trying to get some code to work which previosuly didn't because I hadn't had R working on my laptop. Since it does now, I tried.
I ran into many errors which I will put in the md, in otherwords, it did not work even though I had R properly installed.

I tried the coding work week 6 as well, but still to no avail. The same was the case for the week 7 work.

I actually have no idea what I'm doing wrong, I'm following all the steps with the coding and it should be working.

The biggest win, or perhaps only win I have achieved between the previous consolidation week and this one, is having Dr. Graham help me to get R working.
I am glad that R does work on my laptop, but for some reason all the code still doesn't work, see the md files. 

"We are literally atop
untold histories: things, ideas, lives, and
activities that we have never seen before,
that we may know nothing of, and that
can thus endlessly surprise and transform
us. The very nature of archaeology, as a
subject open to interpretation when new
techniques, voices, and intellectual frameworks are introduced, furthers this facility
for surprise and transformation" Perry S. The Enchantment of the Archaeological Record. European Journal of Archaeology. 2019;22(3):355. doi:10.1017/eaa.2019.24 link

This was a nice quote to consider going into this weeks work, even if nothing went according to plan. The possibility and potential for discovery and learning is what kept me pushing to get the work and readings done.

I am not really sure what grade I think I deserve, but since nothing worked for me I don't really want to suggest A, but I also don't want to ask for a B. I am still glad R now works, I would just like to see it actually work with the code
